# Emergence of Distance in the W-Structure

## 1. Ontological Status of Distance

In the W-Structure, **distance is not fundamental**.

At the ontological level:
- no metric exists,
- no length exists,
- no radius or extension exists.

A point/field is informational, not geometric.
Distinctness precedes separation.

---

## 2. Informational Adjacency

Cells generated by Minimal Informational Acts (MIAs) are:

- distinct informationally,
- adjacent by admissibility,
- not separated metrically.

Adjacency means:
> two informational configurations are distinguishable
> without any notion of spatial interval.

This adjacency is purely informational.

---

## 3. Local Distance as Informational Count

After projection, **local distance** appears as a count of informational transitions.

Formally:
\[
d_{\mathrm{loc}} \sim \#(\text{informational transitions})
\]

No continuous extension is assumed.
Distance is discrete at the level of informational structure.

---

## 4. Zero Ontological Distance

Between adjacent informational cells:
- distance is not zero,
- distance is not infinitesimal,
- distance is **undefined**.

This is the **zero ontological distance interval**:
absence of metric, not minimal metric.

---

## 5. Emergence of Global Distance

Global distance appears only after:
- accumulation of MIAs,
- stabilization of adjacency relations,
- synchronization via the seam \( W \).

Only then can adjacency be projected into a global geometric structure.

---

## 6. Seam Calibration and the Role of \( \pi^2 \)

The same invariant governing global time governs global distance.

Due to the compactification geometry of the W-structure:
- straight trajectories close into circles,
- global extension corresponds to winding around \( W \),
- informational measures are quadratic.

Thus, the seam calibration invariant

\[
K_w = \pi^2
\]

sets the **minimal closure threshold**
for the emergence of global distance.

---

## 7. Planck Length as a Projection Threshold

Planck length \( \ell_P \) is **not the size of a cell**.

It is the **minimal non-zero metric separation**
that appears when informational adjacency
is projected into geometry.

After projection:
\[
\text{distance} \sim (\text{number of informational transitions}) \times \ell_P.
\]

Ontologically, no distance exists.

---

## 8. Simultaneity of Emergence

Because both time and distance are undefined ontologically:

- generation of cells is simultaneous in all directions,
- no propagation speed exists at the ontological level.

Causality, propagation, and light cones arise
only after projection into synchronized geometry.

---

## 9. Summary

- Distance is not fundamental.
- Informational adjacency precedes geometry.
- Metric distance is a projection of informational structure.
- Planck length is a projection threshold, not a minimal size.
- The invariant \( \pi^2 \) calibrates global distance just as it calibrates global time.

# Emergence of Time in the W-Structure

## 1. Information-First Premise

In the W-Structure, **information is ontologically primary**.

- Nothing is defined as the absence of information.
- A point/field already carries information.
- Time is not a dimension and not a background parameter.

Time appears only as a **metric of informational change**.

---

## 2. Minimal Informational Act Revisited

A point/field admits an informational configuration with multiple
PAN-consistent alternatives.

**Minimal Informational Act (MIA)** is the minimal act of
**reorganization of this informational configuration**, expressed as
the emergence of a new distinguishability between admissible states.

Thus:

- information exists prior to MIA;
- MIA is the **first non-zero step of informational variability**.

There is no creation of information from nothing —
only its minimal change.

---

## 3. Local Time: Informational Ticks

**Local time** arises as a metric of informational change:

\[
t_{\mathrm{loc}} \sim \Delta I.
\]

Each MIA constitutes a **local informational tick**.

If no MIA occurs:
- no informational change exists,
- local time is undefined.

There is no notion of duration, flow, or ordering
at the ontological level of the act itself.

This is the **zero ontological time interval**:
not zero time, but absence of time.

## 4. Absence of Global Time at the Ontological Level

Because MIAs occur locally and independently,
there is initially:

- no global ordering,
- no simultaneity,
- no universal clock.

The ontological structure consists only of
unordered local informational transitions.

---

## 5. Emergence of Global Time

**Global time** is not fundamental.
It emerges only through **synchronization** of local informational ticks.

Synchronization requires:

- accumulation of MIAs,
- PAN-consistent variability trajectories,
- a stable global normalization.

Without such normalization, global time is undefined.

## 6. Seam Calibration and the Role of \( \pi^2 \)

The compactification geometry of the W-structure implies:

- any straight trajectory closes into a circle,
- global unfolding corresponds to winding around the seam \( W \),
- informational measures are quadratic.

Therefore, the invariant

\[
K_w = \pi^2
\]

is **not a model parameter** and not a physical constant.

**Definition.**  
\( K_w = \pi^2 \) is the **seam calibration invariant**
induced by the compactification geometry of the W-structure:
straight trajectories close into circles, and informational measures are quadratic.

This invariant sets the minimal closure threshold at which
global synchronization becomes possible.

---

## 7. Planck Time as a Projection Threshold

Planck time \( t_P \) is **not** the smallest time.

It is the **minimal non-zero projection** of synchronized informational change
into a sequential physical description.

Ontologically:
- time is undefined.

Physically:
- time appears discretized,
- bounded below by \( t_P \).

Thus, Planck time is a **threshold of representation**, not a limit of reality.

---

## 8. Summary

- Time is a metric of informational change.
- MIA provides local informational ticks.
- No time exists ontologically at the act level.
- Global time emerges only through synchronization.
- \( \pi^2 \) is the geometric calibration invariant of the seam.
- Planck time is a projection threshold, not a fundamental bound.

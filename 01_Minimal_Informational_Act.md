# Minimal Informational Act (MIA)

## 1. Ontological Premise

In the W-Structure, **information is primary**.

- **Nothing** is defined as the absence of information.
- A **point/field** already constitutes information.
- Geometry, time, distance, and dynamics are secondary projections.

No physical or mathematical structure exists prior to information.

## 2. PAN — Principle of Absolute Non-Contradiction

All admissible informational evolutions must satisfy PAN:

> No informational state or transition may contain internal contradiction.

PAN is not a rule of logic but an ontological constraint:
contradictory configurations are non-realizable.

---

## 3. Definition: Minimal Informational Act (MIA)

**Definition (MIA).**  
A *Minimal Informational Act* is the emergence of a non-contradictory
**distinguishability event** between at least two admissible alternatives
of a point/field under PAN.

It is not:
- a value,
- a magnitude,
- a direction,
- or a quantity.

It **is** the fact that:
> one admissible alternative becomes realized and therefore distinguishable
> from the others.

Without distinguishability, information is undefined.

---

## 4. Lemma: Existence and Minimality

**Lemma.**  
If a point/field admits a non-empty set of PAN-consistent alternatives,
then the realization of the first alternative necessarily produces
a unique MIA.

**Minimality.**  
No weaker event than distinguishability can generate information.
Therefore, MIA is ontologically minimal.

---

## 5. Corollary: Phase Activation \( 0 \rightarrow W \)

Class \(0\) is defined as the complete absence of information
(no distinguishability).

The appearance of an MIA immediately moves the system out of class \(0\)
into class \(W\):

\[
\text{MIA} \;\Longrightarrow\; 0 \rightarrow W.
\]

This transition is **atomic** and admits no intermediate informational states.

---

## 6. Time Emergence (Local)

Time is not primitive.

**Local time** arises as a metric of information change:

\[
t_{\text{loc}} \sim \Delta I.
\]

A single MIA constitutes a **local informational tick**.
If no MIA occurs, local time is undefined.

The ontological transition itself has:
- no duration,
- no flow,
- no ordering.

This is the **zero ontological time interval**.

---

## 7. Distance Emergence (Local)

Ontologically, no notion of distance exists.

Cells generated by MIAs are:
- distinct informationally,
- not separated metrically.

Adjacency precedes geometry.

Metric distance appears only after projection, as a count of informational
transitions.

---

## 8. Toward Global Structure

Accumulation of MIAs along PAN-consistent variability trajectories
produces synchronization.

Only after sufficient accumulation does:
- **global time** (ordering of local ticks),
- **global distance** (metric separation),
- **geometry**

become definable.

The closure and quantization of this accumulation at the seam \(W\)
is governed by the invariant quantum \(K_w = \pi^2\),
treated in subsequent sections.

---

## 9. Summary

- MIA is the **minimal birth of information**.
- Time and distance are **emergent**, not fundamental.
- The transition \(0 \rightarrow W\) is triggered by MIA.
- Planck-scale quantities arise only at the level of projection,
  not ontology.

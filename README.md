## Single Consistency Law (W-Law)

Reality is a **self-consistent informational structure**.

A state or an evolution is realizable and stable **if and only if**
it does not generate contradiction, neither locally nor globally.

This is the only foundational law.
All notions below arise as unavoidable consequences of this law.
No axioms are assumed.

---

## Immediate Consequences of the W-Law

From global and local self-consistency it follows that:

- **Nothing** is the limit case of zero distinguishability
  (no informational constraints, no structure).
- A **point/field** is informationally non-empty, since it imposes
  distinguishability constraints.
- At the ontological level, **values, magnitudes, directions, time,
  and distance are undefined**.

Only informational consistency exists prior to any metric representation.

## Minimal Informational Act (MIA)

**Definition.**  
A *Minimal Informational Act (MIA)* is the minimal reorganization of an
informational configuration that produces a **new, non-contradictory
distinguishability** between admissible alternatives of a point/field.

MIA is not:
- a value,
- a direction,
- a magnitude,

but the **fact of distinguishability itself**.

Without distinguishability, information is undefined.
Therefore, MIA is the minimal non-zero informational event allowed by the W-Law.

---

## Phase Activation: 0 → W

Class **0** corresponds to zero distinguishability
(the absence of information).

The appearance of the first MIA necessarily moves the system out of class 0:

\[
\text{MIA} \;\Longrightarrow\; 0 \rightarrow W
\]

This transition is ontological and atomic.
No intermediate informational states are possible.

---

## Time as an Informational Metric

Time is not fundamental.

From the W-Law it follows that ordering can appear
only through **change of information**.

Local time emerges as a metric of informational change:

\[
t_{\text{loc}} \sim \Delta I
\]

- If no informational change occurs, time is **undefined**, not zero.
- The ontological transition \(0 \rightarrow W\) has **no duration**.

Local time consists of discrete informational “ticks”.
Global time emerges only through synchronization of such local changes.

---

## Planck Time

Planck time is **not** the smallest possible time.

It is the minimal **non-zero temporal unit** that appears when
ontological informational acts are projected into a sequential,
causal representation.

Ontologically: time is undefined.  
Physically: time appears discretized and bounded below.

Planck time is therefore a **projection threshold**, not an ontological limit.

---

## Distance and Informational Adjacency

Ontologically, distance does not exist.

Informational cells:
- have no size,
- have no radius,
- have no internal geometry.

They are distinct **only by informational distinguishability**.

Spatial growth occurs through the creation of new informational cells,
not through geometric extension.

---

## Planck Length

Planck length is **not** the size of a cell.

It is the minimal **non-zero geometric projection**
of informational distinctness.

After projection:

\[
\text{distance} \sim
(\text{number of informational transitions}) \times \ell_P
\]

Ontologically, no metric distance is present.

---

## The Seam W

Global self-consistency requires that all divergent processes
share a common closure.

This closure is the **seam W**.

- \( \infty \) denotes divergence as a process.
- **W** is a topological point produced by compactification.

Therefore:

\[
\infty \neq W
\]

Locally, objects behave as points.
Globally, each point unfolds as a field due to compactification.

---

## Seam Quantization

Accumulation of MIAs along a non-contradictory variability trajectory
produces increasing informational curvature.

Near the seam W, this accumulation is compactified into a finite invariant:

\[
K_w = \pi^2
\]

This value is not a model parameter and not a physical constant.
It follows inevitably from:

- global closure of trajectories (circular geometry),
- quadratic stability of informational measures.

The same invariant fixes the universal density cutoff:

\[
D^* = \frac{1}{\pi^2}
\]

Only beyond this threshold do global structures
(including global time and global distance)
become well-defined.

---

## Consequences

- No contradictions at infinity.
- No fundamental minimal time or length.
- Planck units are projection thresholds, not ontological limits.
- Space grows informationally, not geometrically.
- Local and global time arise through synchronization.

---

## Repository Scope

This repository contains the **foundational layer only**.

All definitions and consequences follow from the single consistency law.
No applications, simulations, or empirical models are included here.

All other W-Structure modules reference this repository
as the canonical base.

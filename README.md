## Core Statement

The W-Structure is an information-first foundational framework.
It treats space, time, and physical observables not as primitives, but as
secondary projections of informational structure.

Information is primary.
Geometry, time, and dynamics emerge only after informational acts occur.

---

## Ontological Baseline

- **Nothing** is defined as the absence of information.
- A **point/field** already constitutes information.
- There are no values, magnitudes, directions, time, or distance at the ontological level.

The minimal distinction between admissible alternatives is the first possible form of information.

---

## Minimal Informational Act (MIA)

**Definition.**  
A *Minimal Informational Act (MIA)* is the emergence of a non-contradictory
distinguishability event between admissible alternatives of a point/field,
under the Principle of Absolute Non-Contradiction (PAN).

MIA is:
- not a value,
- not a direction,
- not a magnitude,

but the **fact of distinguishability itself**.

Without distinguishability, information is undefined.

---

## Phase Activation: 0 → W

Class **0** is defined as the absence of information.
The realization of the first MIA is sufficient to move the system out of class 0.

\[
\text{MIA} \;\Longrightarrow\; 0 \rightarrow W
\]

This transition is ontological and atomic.
It does not admit intermediate states.

---

## Time: Informational Metric

Time is not fundamental.

Time is defined as a metric of information change:

\[
t_{\text{loc}} \sim \Delta I
\]

- If no informational change occurs, time is **undefined**, not zero.
- The ontological act \(0 \rightarrow W\) has **no duration**.

Local time arises as discrete informational “ticks”.
Global time emerges only through synchronization of local informational changes.

---

## Planck Time

Planck time is **not** the smallest possible time.

It is the minimal **non-zero projected temporal unit** that appears when
ontological informational acts are read sequentially in a causal representation.

Ontologically: time is undefined.  
Physically: time is discretized and bounded below.

---

## Distance and Spatial Cells

Ontologically, distance does not exist.

Spatial cells:
- have no size,
- have no radius,
- have no internal geometry.

They are distinct **only informationally**.

Spatial growth occurs by the creation of new informational cells,
not by extending lengths.

---

## Planck Length

Planck length is **not** the size of a cell.

It is the minimal **non-zero geometric projection** of informational distinctness.

After projection:

\[
\text{distance} \sim (\text{number of informational transitions}) \times \ell_P
\]

---

## The Seam W

W is the seam of compactification.

- \( \infty \) is a divergent process inside space.
- **W is a topological point**, where all divergent processes are sewn together.

Key distinction:

\[
\infty \neq W
\]

Locally, objects behave as points.
Globally, every point unfolds as a field.

---

## Seam Quantization

Near the seam W, accumulation of Minimal Informational Acts along a
PAN-consistent variability trajectory is compactified into a finite invariant:

\[
K_w = \pi^2
\]

This is not a fitted constant.
It is the minimal informational curvature required for stable closure at the seam.

It fixes the universal density cutoff:

\[
D^* = \frac{1}{\pi^2}
\]

Only beyond this threshold do global structures (including global time)
become well-defined.

---

## Consequences

- No contradictions at infinity.
- No fundamental minimal time or length.
- Planck units are projection thresholds, not ontological limits.
- Space grows informationally, not geometrically.
- Local and global time are emergent synchronization schemes.
